# Travel Personality Classification Project

## Overview
This project classifies users into travel personality types using machine learning models implemented in both **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch** within a single notebook.

## Objectives
- Demonstrate TensorFlow and PyTorch frameworks within the same notebook.
- Showcase model-building, training, and evaluation for multi-class classification.

## Dataset
Features include demographic information and preferences:
- Age
- Location
- Budget Preference
- Adventure Score
- Luxury Score
- Cultural Interest
- Nature Lover Score

## Model Architectures
The notebook contains:
- **TensorFlow model:** A fully connected neural network.
- **PyTorch model:** A similar neural network structure for comparison.

## Results
Both models achieved high classification accuracy on the travel personality dataset, showing the flexibility of TensorFlow and PyTorch for neural network-based tasks.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow
- PyTorch
- pandas, numpy, scikit-learn
